Each execution contest have three main parts:
 1) variable envirnoment
 2) scope chain
 3) this keyword

 scope chain
 ------------------------------------------
 scoping controls how our program's variable are organised and accessed.

 Lexical scoping: Scoping is controlled by placement of functions and blocks in the code.


scope or envirnoment in which a certain variable is declared.
        there are 3 scopes-
                          a) global scope
                          b) function scope
                          c) block scope (ES6)
scope of variable: Region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed.

global scope-> 
                it is outside any function or block.
               variables are declared in global scope are accessible every where.

function scope->
                variable accessible only inside function.NOT outside.
                also called as local scope.

block scope ->
              variable accesible only inside block (example: if block)
              only let and const are block scoped.
              if we declare a variable with var then that varibale can be accesible outside the block also.
              function also block scoped only in strict mode

TDZ- Temporal Dead Zone
Makes easier and catch errors : accessing variables before declaration is 
bad practice and should be avoided.

Makes const variable actually work. As we know const can not be reassigned.
So it is
